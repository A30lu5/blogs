# Doubletrouble

Shellcoding with doubles

# Flag
{4_d0ub1e_d0ub1e_3ntr3ndr3} make it 1337ish

# Description
i didn't have a flag in mind, and didn't really have a description, although I could come
        up with one. Do you have any theme you are trying to stick with?
credit: just say nsnc anywhere
Hidden in a comment in the source code, I don't care.
Feel free to take liberties with the challenge description, but at least use one pun.
