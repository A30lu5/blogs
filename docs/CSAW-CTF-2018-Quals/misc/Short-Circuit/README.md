Start from the monkey's paw and work your way down the high voltage line, for every wire that is branches off has an element that is either on or off. Ignore the first bit. Standard flag format.

Hint: There are 112 Things You Need to Worry About

Solution:

From the monkey's paw, follow the main line down the page.

Label every diode on or off 1 or 0.

Then go to each and every line coming off of the main line (except where labeled - I drew four lines instead of two, and made two lines come to one point instead of two connections), assigning each line to value of the connected light emitting diode.  Drop the first bit/line.  It's ascii.
