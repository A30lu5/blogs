I was filled with muse in the last weekend and decided to write a story. For this great cause, I used my all time favorite text editor - Sublime. After writing for hours long, I decided to rest my pen for the day and go to sleep. It was all good until I woke up and saw my piece of art in the next day's morning. I could not read it, it was all gibberish! I saw a file in the same directory as my masterpiece which was not there the day before and it is attached to this challenge. Please save my fine literature! I would be heartbroken if it is lost forever...
