Dear Author,
Your story was enjoyable as it gets. In fact, it was so enjoyable that
I decided to copy it to my computer and encrypt your version of it
so that I will be the only one to be able to enjoy it. I would not
leave you empty handed though - have this:
a = 4, e = 3, o = 0, l = 1

Sincerely,
G.
